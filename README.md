CSS heavy profile page
Greetings!  I wanted a way to display my love of CSS; After Effects, and Premier whilst still coding something unique to me.   
I have always looked to the sky and thought how peaceful being a baloonist must be.  This was created as a vanilla profile page. 
This was my orginal miro concept.

All pictures and assets were made by yours truly with the exception of the cloud sequence- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8ACyHYsb6Q&t=1650s&ab_channel=Cloud9.

The music can be obtained here.
